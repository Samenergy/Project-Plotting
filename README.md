# Project Plotting - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Histograms, and Boxplots

## Overview

This project is part of an assignment focused on analyzing fuel efficiency data. The dataset contains various attributes related to vehicle fuel efficiency, including CO2 emissions, engine displacement, and other factors.

The goals of this project are:
1. **Visualization**: Create and analyze histograms and other plots to understand the distribution of different variables in the dataset.
2. **Exploration**: Use statistical techniques and visualization tools to explore the relationships between variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is related to fuel efficiency and includes several columns such as:
- `co2`: CO2 emissions (in grams per kilometer)
- `comb`: Combined fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon)
- `displ`: Engine displacement (in liters)
- Other attributes related to vehicle characteristics.

## Tools and Libraries

The following Python libraries were used in this project:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For making statistical graphics.

## Visualizations

### 1. CO2 Emissions Distribution
- A histogram was plotted to show the distribution of CO2 emissions across different vehicles. The plot was customized with a green color to make the distribution more visually appealing.

### 2. Fuel Efficiency Distribution
- A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon) among the vehicles in the dataset.

### 3. Engine Displacement Distribution
- The distribution of engine displacement was analyzed using a histogram. The plot was initially in blue but can be customized to any color for better clarity.

### 4. Correlation Heatmap
- A heatmap was generated to show the correlation between different numeric variables in the dataset. This helps in identifying which variables are positively or negatively correlated.

### 5. Additional Analysis
- Further analysis included creating pair plots, boxplots, and other statistical plots to dive deeper into the data.

## To-Do

- **Task 1**: Create a histogram that displays the distribution of carbon dioxide emissions.
- **Task 2**: Plot a series of other histograms based on columns of your choice to better understand the data distribution.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Samenergy/Project-Plotting.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Project-Plotting`
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Plotting-Assignment.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Plotting-Assignment.ipynb
   ```
5. Run the cells in the notebook to generate the visualizations and analysis.
